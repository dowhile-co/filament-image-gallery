# Changelog

## v2.1.4 - 2025-12-17

### Added
- `overlap()` method for `ImageGalleryColumn` to match Filament's API

  - Moved Viewer.js initialization to dynamically loaded JavaScript
  - Assets are now loaded on-demand when galleries are detected
  - Works seamlessly with Livewire 3.x SPA navigation
- **Stacked Layout**: Fixed stacked images not displaying correctly due to Tailwind dynamic class generation
  - Replaced Tailwind `-space-x-*` classes with inline `margin-inline-start` styles

### Changed
